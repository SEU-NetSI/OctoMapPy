"""
This script shows the basic use of the MotionCommander class.

Simple example that connects to the crazyflie at `URI` and runs a
sequence. This script requires some kind of location system, it has been
tested with (and designed for) the flow deck.

The MotionCommander uses velocity setpoints.

Change the URI variable to your Crazyflie configuration.
